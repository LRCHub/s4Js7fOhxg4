When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that she could
see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to
lose my head
This situation
Leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?
I don't know
If I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She Loves Me Not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise?
She Loves Me Not
Loves me not
Over the past 5 years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and
watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
she says She Loves Me Not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship I want out
today, this is over
I don't know
If I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She Loves Me Not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise?
She Loves Me Not
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk
Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fighting all
the goddamn time
It's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid, mad
On the real could you feel
What I feel?
What's the deal girl?
We're tearing up each other's
world
We should be in harmony, boy
and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things
wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby, we can
scream and shout
I don't know
If I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She Loves Me Not
Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise?
She Loves Me Not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
Life's not fair
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
She Loves Me Not
Loves me not
